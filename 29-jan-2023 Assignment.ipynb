    "\n",
    "Ans. Python is both compiled as well as an interpreted language, which means when we run a python code, it is first compiled and then interpreted line by line but the compilation part is hidden from the programmer. The compile part gets deleted as soon as the code gets executed in Python so that the programmer doesn’t get onto unnecessary complexity."

    "\n",
    "1. Functions: Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be called multiple times in a program. They are defined using the \"def\" keyword, followed by the function name and the function parameters in parentheses.\n",
    "2. Classes: Classes are blocks of code that define objects and their behaviors. They are defined using the \"class\" keyword, followed by the class name and a colon.\n",
    "3. Loops: Loops are blocks of code that repeat a set of instructions for a specified number of times or until a certain condition is met. There are two main types of loops in Python: \"for\" loops and \"while\" loops.\n",
    "4. Conditional statements: Conditional statements are blocks of code that execute a set of instructions based on a condition. The two main types of conditional statements in Python are \"if\" statements and \"if-else\" statements.\n",
    "5. Try-except blocks: Try-except blocks are blocks of code used to handle exceptions (errors) that may occur during the execution of a program. The \"try\" block contains the code that may raise an exception, and the \"except\" block contains the code that will be executed if an exception occurs."
